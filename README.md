# Decentralized Event Network POC
Just messing around for now

## To get started with development
1. `yarn dev:install` to build the dev docker containers
2. `yarn dev:up` to start the hot-reloading dev system

That's it!

## Project breakdown
- `/api` is the backend server
- `/app` is the frontend React application
- `/config` is where project configuration files live
- `/docker` is where we keep the docker configurations
- `/script` is a home for utility scripts
